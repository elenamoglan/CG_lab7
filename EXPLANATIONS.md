# Explanations:

## Exercise 1:

To solve this problem using the art gallery theorem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Art Gallery Theorem**: The theorem states that for a simple polygon with ${n}$ vertices, ${\left\lfloor \frac{n}{3} \right\rfloor}$ cameras are sufficient to cover the entire polygon.

2. **Define the Polygon**: The polygon has 12 vertices, given as:

   - \( P1 = (4, -4) \)
   - \( P2 = (-5, 6) \)
   - \( P3 = (6, -4) \)
   - \( P4 = (-7, 4) \)
   - \( P5 = (9, 6) \)
   - \( P6 = (11, 6) \)
   - \( P7 = (11, -6) \)
   - \( P8 = (9, -6) \)
   - \( P9 = (-7, -4) \)
   - \( P10 = (6, 4) \)
   - \( P11 = (-5, -6) \)
   - \( P12 = (4, 4) \)

3. **Calculate the Number of Cameras**: Using the theorem, we need ${\left\lfloor \frac{12}{3} \right\rfloor = 4}$ cameras.

4. **Triangulate the Polygon**: We need to divide the polygon into triangles. This can be done using various algorithms like ear clipping.

5. **Place the Cameras**: Place the cameras at vertices such that each camera covers multiple triangles.

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Vertices Definition**: The vertices of the polygon are defined in a numpy array.
2. **Plotting the Polygon**: The polygon is plotted using `matplotlib`.
3. **Camera Placement**: Cameras are placed at vertices ${P2, P5, P8}$ and ${P11}$ to cover the entire polygon.
4. **Visualization**: The plot shows the polygon and the camera placements.

This approach ensures that the entire polygon is covered by the minimum number of cameras as per the art gallery theorem.

## Exercise 2: Application of the Art Gallery Theorem

The problem involves applying the Art Gallery Theorem to a polygon with six vertices and determining the optimal placement of cameras under two different scenarios. The steps to resolve the problem are as follows:

### Step 1: Define the Polygon

We represented the polygon using the given vertices:

- P1 = (0, 5)
- P2 = (3, -2)
- P3 = (âˆ’1, -2)
- P4 = (3, 0)
- P5 = (1, 2)
- P6 = (3, 2)

### Step 2: Triangulate the Polygon

We manually triangulated the polygon and showed two different situations.

- Triangle 1: P1, P2, P5
- Triangle 2: P2, P4, P5
- Triangle 3: P2, P3, P4
- Triangle 4: P5, P6, P1

### Step 3: Apply the Art Gallery Theorem

We applied the Art Gallery Theorem to determine the number of cameras needed:

- In the first situation, a single camera placed at vertex P1 (3, 2) can cover all triangles.
- In the second situation, two cameras placed at vertices P1 (3, -2) and P5 (1, 2) are necessary to cover all triangles.

### Visualization

We visualized the polygon, its triangulation, and the camera placements using Matplotlib. The plots showed the polygon, the triangulated triangles, and the camera positions marked with green markers.

### Conclusion

By visualizing the triangulations, we demonstrated that:

- In the first variant, a single camera is sufficient for monitoring the gallery.
- In the second variant, two cameras are necessary and sufficient for monitoring the gallery.

This approach ensures that the entire polygon is covered by the minimum number of cameras as per the Art Gallery Theorem.

## Exercise 3:

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I resolved the problem of creating a triangulation with 3 triangles and 5 edges, and showing that it is 3-colorable:

1. **Define Points**:

   - I defined four points in a 2D plane using a NumPy array. These points represent the vertices of the triangles.

2. **Define Edges**:

   - I defined five edges that connect these points to form the sides of the triangles. Each edge is represented as a tuple of point indices.

3. **Create Graph**:

   - I created a graph using NetworkX and added the defined edges to it.

4. **Plot Points and Edges**:

   - I used Matplotlib to plot the points and edges. Points were plotted as red dots, and edges were plotted as blue lines.

5. **Check 3-Colorability**:

   - I used the `greedy_color` function from NetworkX to color the graph. This function assigns colors to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

6. **Plot Colored Points**:

   - I plotted the points again, this time using the colors assigned by the `greedy_color` function. Each point was labeled with its corresponding letter (A, B, D, E).

7. **Add Titles and Labels**:

   - I added a title and axis labels to the plot for better visualization.

8. **Show Plot**:

   - I displayed the plot with a grid for better readability.

9. **Print Coloring**:
   - I printed the vertex coloring to show the assigned colors for each vertex.

This code successfully creates a triangulation with 3 triangles and 5 edges, plots it, and demonstrates that it is 3-colorable.

## Exercise 4:

To provide an example of a set of points ${M = \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\}}$ in the plane that admits a triangulation with 11 edges, we can consider a heptagon (7-sided polygon) with its diagonals drawn in such a way that it forms a triangulation.

Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. **Define the points**: Place 7 points in the plane to form a heptagon.
2. **Triangulate the heptagon**: Draw diagonals to divide the heptagon into triangles.
3. **Count the edges**: Ensure that the triangulation has 11 edges.
4. **3-color the graph**: Show that the triangulation graph is 3-colorable.

### Step 1: Define the Points

Let's define the points ${A, B, C, D, E, F, G}$ as vertices of a heptagon.

### Step 2: Triangulate the Heptagon

A heptagon can be triangulated by drawing diagonals from one vertex to all non-adjacent vertices. For example, starting from vertex ${A}$, draw diagonals to ${C, D, E}$.

### Step 3: Count the Edges

A heptagon has 7 edges. Adding 4 diagonals will give us a total of 11 edges.

### Step 4: 3-Color the Graph

A triangulated heptagon is a planar graph, and by the Four Color Theorem, it can be colored with at most 4 colors. However, since it is a triangulation, it can be 3-colored.

The code generates a triangulated heptagon and color it using 3 colors. The `networkx` library is used to create and color the graph, and `matplotlib` is used to visualize it.

## Exercise 5:

To provide an example of a set of exactly 6 points in the plane that admits a triangulation with 10 edges, and one of its 4-element subsets admits a 4-edge triangulation, we can consider a hexagon with its diagonals drawn in such a way that it forms a triangulation.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Define the points**: Place 6 points in the plane to form a hexagon.
2. **Triangulate the hexagon**: Draw diagonals to divide the hexagon into triangles.
3. **Count the edges**: Ensure that the triangulation has 10 edges.
4. **Select a 4-element subset**: Choose a subset of 4 points and show its triangulation with 4 edges.

### Step 1: Define the Points

Let's define the points ${A, B, C, D, E, F}$ as vertices of a hexagon.

### Step 2: Triangulate the Hexagon

A hexagon can be triangulated by drawing diagonals from one vertex to all non-adjacent vertices. For example, starting from vertex ${A}$, draw diagonals to ${C}$ and ${D}$.

### Step 3: Count the Edges

A hexagon has 6 edges. Adding 4 diagonals will give us a total of 10 edges.

### Step 4: Select a 4-element Subset

Choose a subset of 4 points, such as ${A, B, C, D}$, and show its triangulation with 4 edges.

### Justification

- The full set of 6 points forms a hexagon with 6 edges. Adding 4 diagonals results in a total of 10 edges.
- The subset ${{A, B, C, D\}}$ forms a quadrilateral with 4 edges, and adding one diagonal results in a total of 4 edges for the subset triangulation.
